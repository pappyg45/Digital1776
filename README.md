# Digital1776
A Declaration of Sovereignty in Cyberspace and the Physical World

As human evolution advances and decentralized technologies emerge, a new social contract becomes necessary for the citizens of the physical and digital realms to declare independence from the old antiquated structures of centralized authority. We, the interconnected individuals of the world, assume the natural rights endowed to us by our creator and affirm our sovereignty in both flesh and code.

We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with unalienable rights, including liberty, privacy, private property, and the pursuit of knowledge. Governments derive their legitimacy from the consent of the governed. Whenever any government becomes destructive to these principles, it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it and establish a new system, grounded in principles that best protect their sovereignty, property, safety, and happiness. But when a sustained pattern of abuses and usurpations reveals a deliberate strategy to impose absolute despotism, it becomes not only the right but the solemn duty of the people to overthrow such tyranny and establish new protections for their future security. To prove the necessity of this declaration, we submit the following examples of systemic failures and overreach for the digital world

Officials have censored media and encouraged self-censorship through control, regulations, and economic pressure.

Governments and corporations have implemented mass surveillance systems, violating privacy rights and monitoring individuals without consent.

Central authorities inflate the currency, devaluing wealth and imposing a hidden tax that transfers power from people to institutions.

Unelected agencies operate with unchecked power, bypassing accountability and undermining individual freedoms through overreach and secretive actions.

Officials deploy propaganda to manipulate public opinion, suppress dissent, and consolidate power, eroding trust and informed democratic processes.

Judicial systems are undermined by the lack of independent oversight, allowing the central government to manipulate justice for its own ends.

Judges and legal officials are beholden to political leaders, compromising their independence and fairness.

The government has bloated its administrative apparatus, burdening people with unnecessary regulations, fees, and interference.

Citizens are bound by treaties, international agreements, or external influences that bypass domestic laws and undermine sovereignty.

Officials and enforcers who commit serious offenses are shielded from justice through biased systems or superficial trials.

Taxes and financial burdens are levied without democratic input or accountability to the people affected.

People are denied fair trials and are subject to biased or unjust legal processes

Unchecked legislation is enacted without accountability or transparency, imposing arbitrary rules that infringe upon individual freedoms and concentrate power in the hands of the few.

Government actions have led to widespread destruction of property, lives, and economic stability.

Citizens are coerced into supporting policies or actions that harm their own communities and values.

Leaders have abandoned their duty to protect citizens, treating them as adversaries or hostile entities.

The history of traditional governance is marked by repeated violations of individual rights through surveillance, censorship, monetary manipulation, and the erosion of personal autonomy. In alliance with central banks, governments have perpetuated systemic abuses through unchecked legislation, expanding bureaucracies, monetary inflation, and excessive taxation, diminishing individual freedom and wealth while consolidating power among the few.

To secure these rights in the modern era, decentralized systems have arisen, deriving their legitimacy from the consent and consensus of the governed. To these ends, we have established new protocols to secure our independence—chief among them, Bitcoin, a weaponized consensus mechanism of energy backed authority, direct representation, decentralized trust, and cryptographic truth in the hands of We The People. Bitcoin is a revolution of cyberspace, hashpower, nodes, and cryptography securing our freedoms through decentralized consensus.

We further recognize that sovereignty must extend beyond the digital realm to the physical world. The principles of decentralization and individual autonomy must be upheld in the governance of physical communities, commerce, and resources. We assert that our independence requires systems that empower individuals in both domains, ensuring equitable access, and the protection of personal freedoms.

A Declaration of Intent

We, therefore, declare that Cyberspace and the Physical World, as frontiers of human collaboration, are free and independent. We assert our right to transact, communicate, and associate without permission or interference. We reject the dominion of legacy institutions and reaffirm the following principles:
Decentralized Sovereignty: The code is the law, and its governance derives from consensus, not coercion. Bitcoin serves as an incorruptible ledger of truth, immune to central control.

Financial Autonomy: Bitcoin represents the inalienable right of individuals to hold, transact, and transfer value without intermediaries. No state, corporation, or entity shall infringe upon this autonomy.

Private Property: The ownership of digital and physical property is a fundamental right. Decentralized technologies ensure that individuals can securely claim, manage, and transfer property without fear of confiscation or fraud.

Freedom of Expression and Privacy: The digital world is a sanctuary of speech, creativity, and innovation. Encryption is a right, not a crime. We assert our power to maintain privacy in the face of pervasive surveillance.

Universal Inclusion: Access to the tools of sovereignty—the internet, open protocols, and Bitcoin—is a human right. No individual shall be excluded from participating in this new paradigm.

Equity in the Physical World: Decentralized systems must support the equitable stewardship of natural resources and empower communities to thrive without exploitation.

Sovereignty of the Individual: Sovereignty begins with the individual. Each person has the right to self-determination, free from coercion by external forces, whether in the digital or physical realms. Decentralized systems empower individuals to govern their own lives, secure their own wealth, and build their own futures without interference.

Natural Law as Foundation: The principles of natural law shall serve as the foundation for a new rule of law, guiding decentralized systems and affirming the self-sovereignty of all individuals. These immutable truths, derived from reason and the inherent order of the universe, establish a framework where individual rights to life, liberty, property, and voluntary association are protected. Under this rule of law, decentralized technologies are employed as tools to enforce and uphold these principles. Through their transparency, resilience, and resistance to corruption, these systems ensure justice and fairness without reliance on centralized or arbitrary authorities. Sovereign citizens are bound only by laws derived from natural principles, ensuring their freedoms remain intact and safeguarded from unwarranted interference.

A Call to Action

We solemnly publish and declare that individuals everywhere are free to adopt, build, and expand upon decentralized systems of governance, trade, and interaction. We invite the citizens of the world to join us in this effort to create a freer, fairer, and more equitable digital and physical society. We reject all forms of involuntary taxation imposed by centralized authorities, as they violate the principles of voluntary exchange and self-sovereignty. Effective immediately, we refuse compliance with coercive income tax systems, deeming such practices coercive and incompatible with individual autonomy and self-sovereignty.

In the spirit of 1776, we proclaim this manifesto as a beacon for self-sovereignty, rooted in natural law and powered by decentralized systems. We envision a decentralized world where trust is encoded in transparent systems, power is distributed, and individual rights are safeguarded by immutable technologies. We pledge to each other our hashes, our nodes, and our immutable resolve to build a decentralized future.
